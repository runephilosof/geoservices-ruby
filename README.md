# GeoServices Ruby Library

This library is a simple wrapper around the GeoServices API. You can see the [GeoServices REST Specification](http://www.esri.com/industries/landing-pages/geoservices/geoservices) or the [Getting Started](https://services.arcgis.com/help/index.html?overview.html)

If you have not worked with GeoServices before, there are a few basic concepts to get started:

* _Service_ is the base and has many layers. This just holds metadata about who created the service, and the layers it contains.
* _Layer_ a layer is like a dataset with many features. You can query a Layer by spatial extent, attribute parameters and even perform aggregations with statistics and group by fields
* _Feature_ an individual location, or record, or row, is called a 'feature'. A feature has many attributes


## Install

Just install using Rubygems:

`gem install geoservices`


## Usage

```ruby
@service = Geoservice::MapService.new(:url => "http://rmgsc.cr.usgs.gov/ArcGIS/rest/services/nhss_weat/MapServer")
@service.layers[0]["name"] #=> "Watches/Warnings"
```

If calling to a secure service, include `:token => TOKEN` in the constructor.

### Query

To request data from a service, you need the URL to the service, the layer index, and then add optional query parameters.

To get all features:

```ruby
service_url = "https://services2.arcgis.com/1gVyYKfYgW5Nxb1V/ArcGIS/rest/services/MesaAzCouncilDistricts/FeatureServer"
service = Geoservice::MapService.new(url: service_url)
features = service.query(0)["features"]
puts features.length #=> 6
puts features.first["attributes"]
#=> {"OBJECTID"=>1, "DISTRICT"=>1, "DISTRICTS"=>"DISTRICT 1", "FACILITYID"=>nil, "GLOBALID"=>"1c14efc5-cef2-4757-a9f5-8be2c3eeab66"}
```

You can also perform spatial queries:

```ruby
params = {
  geometry: [-111.835,33.42].join(','),
  geometryType: "esriGeometryPoint",
  inSR: 4326,
  spatialRel: "esriSpatialRelIntersects",
  units: "esriSRUnit_Meter",
  returnGeometry: false
}
query = service.query(0, params)
puts query["features"]
#=> {"attributes"=>{"OBJECTID"=>4, "DISTRICT"=>4, "DISTRICTS"=>"DISTRICT 4", "FACILITYID"=>nil, "GLOBALID"=>"c9f2f6f1-d210-4332-8610-8ad176ab9d07"}}
```

### Testing

geoservices-ruby uses RSpec for tests. 

    $ rake spec
